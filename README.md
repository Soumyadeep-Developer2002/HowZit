# HowZit
This is a fully functional simple, basic chatting app. Here I am use "Dart" for language, "Flutter" for framework and "Firebase" for Backend and Cloud platform.
In Firebase i am use Authentication, Firestore Database, Messaging. Here I also use some Animation and 1 create a Dart file called "HereAllAPI.dart". gere i am doing all API related work.
UI FLow:
When Someone opens the app for the 1st time, they will first have to login in Login page then they will be able to chat with their friends. Here I am also add search feature. Here the User can view their own details on their profile page. and user can also see friends details. here you can add emoji. 
Here some Pictures that will help you to understand the UI
